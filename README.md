# CK3 Modding Scripts

## Summary

As requested by a developer, some simple scripts to make modding at scale easier

## Setup

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.9 or greater)
2. Download the files from this repository.
 
For safety's sake, don't download these files to the same location as the files to be converted

## Execution

Execution instructions can be found in each `<file>.md` file (e.g. instructions for `culture_conversion.py` can be found in `culture_conversion.md`).  They all follow the same format of running `python file.py argument1 argument2 ...`.

## Bug Reporting

Feel free to leave an issue in this repo, I'll try to fix things if needed.  No promises.  Honestly if you just want to fork this and improve it as you see fit, feel free, no skin off my back.

## Final notes

The `cultures` folder exists as test data to be used, with three files already converted and three unconverted.  Those would be `000_abajeno.txt`, `000_abenaki.txt`, `000_acadien.txt` and `000_maracaju.txt`, `000_margariteno.txt`, and `000_maritimer.txt` respectively.  As bugs are fixed/features added, those files (and more) will be used for testing.  Hey, self, that's a good todo: some automated testing baybee
